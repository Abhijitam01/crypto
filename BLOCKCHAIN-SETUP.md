## Architecture Overview

Our Learn-to-Earn platform uses a blockchain-based token economy to incentivize learning and content creation. The architecture consists of:

- **LearnToken (ERC20)**: The native token of the platform, awarded for completing courses and other activities
- **CourseCompletion Contract**: Manages course completions and awards tokens
- **CertificateNFT (ERC721)**: Issues verifiable certificates as NFTs
- **LearnMarketplace**: Allows users to redeem tokens for rewards

The platform integrates with Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to provide a seamless user experience for managing tokens and certificates.
